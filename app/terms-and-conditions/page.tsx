        5. Conclusion of sales and availability of stock
      </h3>
      <ol className="px-16 text-sm">
        <li>
          1. Registered users may place orders for Goods, which Bronscor may
          accept or reject. Whether or not Bronscor accepts an order depends on
          the availability of Goods, correctness of the information relating to
          the Goods (including without limitation the price) and receipt of
          payment or payment authorisation by Bronscor for the Goods.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. NOTE: Bronscor will indicate the acceptance of your order by
          delivering the Goods to you or allowing you to collect them, and only
          at that point will an agreement of sale between you and Bronscor come
          into effect (the “Sale”). This is regardless of any communication from
          Bronscor stating that your order or payment has been confirmed.
          Bronscor will indicate the rejection of your order (by Bronscor
          itself) by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter,
          refunding you for any amount already paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Prior to delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may cancel
          an order at any time provided you do so before receiving a dispatch or
          delivery notice. After delivery or your collection of the Goods, you
          may return the Goods only in accordance with the Returns Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Placing Goods in a wishlist or shopping basket without completing
          the purchase cycle does not constitute an order for such Goods, and as
          such, Goods may be removed from the shopping basket if stock is no
          longer available or the price thereof might change without notice to
          you. You cannot hold Bronscor liable if such Goods are not available
          or are not available at the particular price when you complete or
          attempt to complete the purchase cycle at a later stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. You acknowledge that stock of all Goods on offer is limited and
          that pricing may change at any time without notice to you. In the case
          of Goods for sale by Bronscor, Bronscor will take all reasonable
          efforts to monitor stock levels and ensure that when stock is no
          longer available, that offers thereof are discontinued on the Website.
          However, we cannot guarantee the availability of stock. When Goods are
          no longer available after you have placed an order, Bronscor will
          notify you and you will be entitled to a refund of any amount already
          paid by you for such Goods.
        </li>
      </ol>

              validity of payment. In such cases we are entitled to withhold
              delivery until such time as the additional information is received
              by us and authorisation is obtained by us for the amounts. If we
              do not receive authorisation your order for the Goods will be
              cancelled. You warrant that you are fully authorised to use the

              the Website;
            </li>
            <li>
              2. credit card: where payment is made by credit card, we may
              require additional information in order to authorise and/or verify

              delivery until such time as the additional information is received
              by us and authorisation is obtained by us for the amounts. If we
              do not receive authorisation your order for the Goods will be

              via direct bank deposit or electronic funds transfer, payment must

          deposit), you will be directed to a link to a secure site for payment
          of the applicable purchase price for the Goods.

          negligence), we shall not be liable for any loss, claim or expense
          relating to a transaction based on any error, save – in the case of

      <ol className="px-16 text-sm">
        <li>
          1. Bronscor may from time to time make physical or electronic gift
          vouchers (“Gift Vouchers”) and promotional coupons or discounts
          (“Coupons”) available for use on the Website towards the purchase of
          Bronscor Goods. Gift Vouchers and Coupons can only be redeemed while
          they are valid and their expiry dates cannot be extended. More

          <ol className="px-4 text-xs py-2">
            <li>
              1. Gift Vouchers that are purchased by registered users are valid
              for 3 years after Sale. Gift Vouchers that Bronscor gives away for
              free are valid for the period stated thereon. In each case, if
              your Voucher has not been used within that period, it will expire.
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Gift Vouchers cannot be used to buy other Gift Vouchers or
              Coupons. They do not accrue interest and are not refundable for
              cash once purchased or otherwise obtained. If your Gift Voucher
              value is less than the amount required to cover the full order you
              wish to place, you may make up the difference by paying via one of
              our other payment methods.

              1. There are two types of Coupons; a Coupon with a fixed amount of
              a discount, e.g. R100 off (“Fixed Coupon“), and a Coupon with a
              percentage discount, e.g. 10% off (“Percentage Coupon“).

              entitled at any time to correct, cancel or reject a Coupon for any
              reason (including without limitation where a Coupon has been
              distributed in an unauthorised manner). Users do not have a right
              to Coupons, and Coupons cannot be earned. Coupons are issued under
              specific terms and conditions regulating when and how they may be
              used.

                  promotion/campaign;
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Percentage Coupons may only be redeemed on purchases with a
                  total cart value of less than R5,000;
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. where a Percentage Coupon has been used and you wish to
                  cancel any items in the order prior to making payment, the
                  entire order must be cancelled. You will be issued with a new
                  Percentage Coupon and will need to place the order again,
                  without the item that you wished to cancel;
                </li>
                <li>
                  6. a Coupon must be used at check-out – it cannot be used
                  later on existing orders; and

        10. Daily Deals and other discounted Goods
      </h3>
      <ol className="px-8 text-sm py-2">
        <li>
          1. From time to time, we may offer certain Goods at discounted prices
          as part of a Daily Deal, Bundle Deal or any other temporary deal which
          are explained below (each a “Deal”). These will be subject to certain
          conditions (as set out in these Terms and/or the Website), which
          define the scope of the Deal. If you buy a product within the scope of
          a Deal, you will pay the discounted price for that product (the “Deal
          Price”).
        </li>
        <li>
          2. However, if you buy a product in a manner that falls outside of the
          scope of a Deal, then you will pay the then current (non-Deal) selling
          price on the Website (the “Normal Price”), for each product that falls
          outside the scope of the Deal.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. For example: if you buy more than one product in a Daily Deal, you
          will pay the Deal Price for the first product, but the Normal Price
          for all products thereafter. Alternatively, if you buy a product in
          combination with any other products that together do not constitute a
          Bundle Deal, you will pay the Normal Price for all such products
          falling outside the scope of the relevant Deal.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Daily Deals
          <ol className="px-8 text-sm py-2">
            <li>
              1. At our discretion, Daily Deals (“Deals”) are available daily
              from 7am – 23:59pm on week days and from 9am – 23:59pm on
              weekends. In addition, please note that Daily Deals have a stock
              limit and may expire earlier if stock runs out.
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Daily Deals quantities are limited and as such, after a Daily
              Deal is sold out, those particular Goods may be available on the
              Website at their normal selling prices (but no longer as a Daily
              Deal).
            </li>
            <li>
              3. We do not guarantee a specific saving. The extent of the Daily
              Deal or discount is at the sole discretion of Bronscor.
            </li>
            <li>
              4. Four of each Daily Deal may be purchased per customer, limited
              to your first order daily.
            </li>
            <li>
              5. Adding a Daily Deal to your cart, or completing your order for
              a Daily Deal without paying for it, does not reserve the item for
              you. Bronscor must receive payment from you within 24 hours of you
              placing your order for a Daily Deal, otherwise we will cancel your
              order.
            </li>
            <li>
              6. Bronscor will reserve stock for customers in the order in which
              it receives payment. Therefore if you pay via EFT, you might not
              get your item because Bronsocr may only receive payment from you a
              few days later, and in the meantime the Daily Deal might sell out
              to customers paying immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              7. The List Price shown in respect of Daily Deals and other
              discounted Goods is the recommended retail price suggested to us
              by the supplier of the relevant product. Where the supplier has
              not provided a recommended retail price, an estimate may be
              provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              8. By purchasing any Daily Deal, you are also automatically opting
              in for our Daily Deals daily newsletter as well as our general
              newsletter (you may opt-out of these newsletters at any time).
              Opting out of these newsletters after purchase will not affect the
              value of the Goods purchased.

          5. Bundle Deals
          <ol className="px-8 text-sm py-2">
            <li>
              1. We may from time to time offer bundle deals for sale under the
              Bundle Deals tab on the Website (“Bundle Deals“). Each Bundle Deal
              will consist of two or more products that either we or you (as
              provided on the Website) have combined together in a single
              bundle.
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Any saving or discount resulting from purchasing a Bundle Deal
              instead of its component products separately may be applied to any
              of the component products individually in our sole discretion. The
              actual purchase price (after applying any applicable saving or
              discount) of each component product will be communicated to you
              upon checkout and reflected in your order history. This is
              relevant to the amount that would be refunded to you, if you were
              to return any product in a Bundle Deal for a refund, in accordance
              with our Returns Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              3. A Bundle Deal should be distinguished from a pre-packed bundle
              compiled by our supplier and supplied to us as a single unit
              (“Pre-packed Bundles“). Any saving or discount in respect of a
              Pre-packed Bundle will be applied only to the total bundle price
              and not to the prices of the individual component products. Please
              refer to our Returns Policy for information about returning a
              Pre-packed Bundle.
