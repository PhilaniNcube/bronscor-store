        5. Conclusion of sales and availability of stock
      </h3>
      <ol className="px-16 text-sm">
        <li>
          1. Registered users may place orders for Goods, which Bronscor may
          accept or reject. Whether or not Bronscor accepts an order depends on
          the availability of Goods, correctness of the information relating to
          the Goods (including without limitation the price) and receipt of
          payment or payment authorisation by Bronscor for the Goods.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. NOTE: Bronscor will indicate the acceptance of your order by
          delivering the Goods to you or allowing you to collect them, and only
          at that point will an agreement of sale between you and Bronscor come
          into effect (the “Sale”). This is regardless of any communication from
          Bronscor stating that your order or payment has been confirmed.
          Bronscor will indicate the rejection of your order (by Bronscor
          itself) by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter,
          refunding you for any amount already paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Prior to delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may cancel
          an order at any time provided you do so before receiving a dispatch or
          delivery notice. After delivery or your collection of the Goods, you
          may return the Goods only in accordance with the Returns Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Placing Goods in a wishlist or shopping basket without completing
          the purchase cycle does not constitute an order for such Goods, and as
          such, Goods may be removed from the shopping basket if stock is no
          longer available or the price thereof might change without notice to
          you. You cannot hold Bronscor liable if such Goods are not available
          or are not available at the particular price when you complete or
          attempt to complete the purchase cycle at a later stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. You acknowledge that stock of all Goods on offer is limited and
          that pricing may change at any time without notice to you. In the case
          of Goods for sale by Bronscor, Bronscor will take all reasonable
          efforts to monitor stock levels and ensure that when stock is no
          longer available, that offers thereof are discontinued on the Website.
          However, we cannot guarantee the availability of stock. When Goods are
          no longer available after you have placed an order, Bronscor will
          notify you and you will be entitled to a refund of any amount already
          paid by you for such Goods.
