      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
        <li>
          It is undamaged and unused, with the original labels and stickers

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">3: Defective products</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        We do our best to ensure that the products we deliver to you are of a
        high quality, and in good working order and without defects.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        What is a defect? A defect is a material imperfection in the manufacture
        of a product or any characteristic of a product, which makes the product
        less acceptable than one would reasonably be entitled to expect in the
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The following will NOT be regarded as defects and will not entitle you
        to a return under this section 3:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
        <li>Faults resulting from normal wear and tear</li>
        <li>
          Damage arising from negligence, user abuse or incorrect usage of the
          product
        </li>
        <li>Damage arising from electrical surges or sea air corrosion</li>
        <li>
          Damage arising from a failure to adequately care for the product
        </li>
        <li>Damage arising from unauthorized alterations to the product</li>
        <li>
          Where the specifications of a product, although accurately described
          on the Website and generally fit for its intended purpose, do not suit
          you
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8">Supplier Warranty</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The products will have a supplier warranty of 12 months. If such a
        product turns out to be defective, please notify us as soon as
        reasonably possible after you become aware of the defect, but in any
        event within the supplier warranty period after delivery / collection of
        the product.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        You can do so by logging a return with us, and we will facilitate your
        return of the product to the supplier at no charge. Unfortunately, we
        cannot facilitate returns that fall outside of the supplier warranty
        period.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Please note that the supplier warranty is subject to whatever terms and
        conditions the supplier or manufacturer may impose. These are usually
        stated in a brochure or leaflet inside or on the product packaging. It
        is your responsibility to make yourself aware of any such terms and
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        It is also important to note that the remedy offered to you is at the
        supplier or manufacturer’s discretion what remedy it can offer you.
        Bronscor is under no obligation to provide you with a credit, repair /
        replacement, as your remedy lies with the supplier or manufacturer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Charges and refunds</h2>
      <p className="mt-4">
        If you return a defective product to us, but you fail to return all of
        the accessories and parts that were sold with that product, we are
        entitled to (subject to applicable law) refuse the return, or only to
        replace the item that you did return; or to estimate the value of the
        missing accessories and parts and to credit or refund you in respect of
        the returned item only.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        If you return a product that does not comply with this Policy, you may
        be liable to reimburse Bronscor for the cost of collecting the product
        from you and the cost of having the product returned to you.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Under no circumstances will donations you make on our Website, or any
        goodwill credit you may receive from us, be refunded.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Please note that we only refund to the payment method that you
        originally used – i.e. payment by credit card will be refunded to the
        same credit card, payment by Instant EFT will be refunded to your
        nominated bank account.
